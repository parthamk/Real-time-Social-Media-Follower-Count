# Real-time Social Media Follower Count
This is an open-source app to explore how social media real-time follower count works.

## Ideas Are Welcome
```
 1. I am thinking maybe we have to use some API
 2. This will not need a database as we are not storing any data
```

Creating a full-fledged social media follower counter React app for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook involves multiple steps, including setting up API access, creating components, handling state, and styling the app. Since this is a complex project, I'll provide you with a high-level step-by-step guide along with some code snippets. Keep in mind that creating such an app might require API keys and authentication credentials from the respective platforms.

**Step 1: Set Up the Project**
1. Create a new React app using Create React App or your preferred setup.
   ```sh
   npx create-react-app social-follower-counter
   cd social-follower-counter
   ```

**Step 2: API Access**
1. Obtain API keys and authentication credentials for each platform:
   - Twitter: Apply for a Twitter Developer account and create a new app to get API keys and tokens.
   - Instagram: Instagram's public API is limited, but you might be able to use web scraping techniques (not recommended due to ToS violations). Consider using third-party services if available.
   - Facebook: Apply for a Facebook Developer account, create an app, and obtain an access token.

**Step 3: Set Up Components**
1. Create a new folder named `components` inside the `src` folder.
2. Inside the `components` folder, create separate files for each platform's follower counter (e.g., `TwitterCounter.js`, `InstagramCounter.js`, `FacebookCounter.js`).

**Step 4: Implement API Calls**
1. Inside each counter component file, import React and `useState` from React, and any other necessary dependencies.
2. Implement API calls to fetch follower counts using `fetch` or a library like `axios`. Use the API keys/tokens obtained earlier.
3. Store the follower count in the component's state using the `useState` hook.

**Step 5: Create a Layout Component**
1. Create a `Layout.js` component to structure the app's layout, including a navigation bar and placeholders for each counter.
2. Import the necessary React components and set up the layout with placeholders for the counters.

**Step 6: Integrate Counters in the Layout**
1. Inside the `Layout.js` component, import the counter components you created earlier.
2. Use the follower counts from each counter's state and display them in the layout.

**Step 7: Styling**
1. Style your app using CSS or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components.
2. Make sure to style the layout, counters, and navigation bar to make the app visually appealing.

**Step 8: Deployment**
1. Deploy your app using platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

**Step 9: Error Handling and Loading States**
1. Implement error handling for failed API requests and loading states while data is being fetched.
2. Display appropriate error messages or loading indicators to enhance the user experience.

Please note that each platform's API and terms of use may change, so ensure you refer to the latest documentation when implementing API calls.

Here's a simplified code snippet for the TwitterCounter component to give you an idea:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const TwitterCounter = () => {
  const [followerCount, setFollowerCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Implement your Twitter API call here and update followerCount
  }, []);

  return (
    <div className="counter">
      <h2>Twitter Followers</h2>
      <p>{followerCount}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default TwitterCounter;
```

Repeat a similar structure for InstagramCounter and FacebookCounter components.

Remember that actual API calls, error handling, and state management might be more complex depending on the specifics of each platform's API and your app's requirements.
